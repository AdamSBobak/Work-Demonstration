This is a personal reimplentation of Rice University's FEAT system, which is used to auto-generate tests for students' Python programs.
This software takes in a series of ranges of various data types representing possible inputs to a target python function.
After conferring with user specified configurations and existing bodies of valid and invalid implementations,
the software generates a set of tests meant to test the full range of functionality of the target function
with emphasis on edge cases identified by the initial data set. This was a project completed in Fall 2020 
that I believe demonstrates both my ability and room for improvement.
